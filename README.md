Resource Management System using Blockchain
### <img src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-256/idea-1618744-1372450.png" width="32" height="32"> Abstract
Blockchain has the ability to keep an incorruptible, decentralized, and transparent 
log of all Natural Resource data makes it a technology rife for security applications. 
Additionally, while blockchain is transparent it is also private, concealing the identity 
of any individual with complex and secure codes that can protect the sensitivity of Resource 
data. The decentralized nature of the technology also allows Resource managers, Government to 
share the same information quickly and safely.

This project effectively stores the data of different resources on the blockchain network. Nowadays we see much Corruption related to natural resources for eg: in Bihar in 1999 when Lalu Yadav was the Minister of Railways he declared that 30 % of coal which came to the energy station was wiped out during transportation. But it was not the case it was sold in black markets for Millions by doing some fraud with the central database which manages the coal records and he was never caught for that because it is easy to manipulate the data which stored centrally at a particular location So by keeping a whole record of all the natural resources which comes to  particular locations on the Block Chain Networks it will be impossible for anyone to do changes in the networks.

### ðŸ“š Tech Stack
- Text editor(like Sublime Text)
- Google Collab
- Streamlit
- Pytezos
- SmartPy(For smartContract)

# How Dapp Works?
We will access our blockchain application with a special web browser that talks to a front-end website written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Instead of talking to a backend web server, this website will talk directly to the blockchain. The blockchain will essentially be our backend, hosting all of the code and data for our decentralized Resource Management System.
### Working of our application  âš™
The block diagram above represents the correct working of the model in that first it will take input from the Resource manager regarding all the data of the Resources which are being received and once the data is saved on the blockchain network and once it is stored on the blockchain network no one can modify that data since it is on the blockchain network.


### ðŸ”‘ Key Features Of the Dapp

Data is stored on the blockchain network
Once the Resource Details are inserted then no one can modify them.
Safe and secure on the Blockchain Network

### How is the proposed solution is Related to sustainable development?

Through our proposed solution we can remove all kinds of corruption or manipulations in data which has been happening till date by editing those databases and once everything is going according to the actual plans there will be very less chances that Natural resources are misused or are stored and sold in the black market 

Our Project may be a small application but it can create a huge impact on managing Natural Resources in our country when all the corruption related to this will come to an end.
