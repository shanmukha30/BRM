Resource Management System using Blockchain
### üìÑ ABSTRACT
Blockchain has the ability to keep an incorruptible, decentralized, and transparent 
log of all Natural Resource data makes it a technology rife for security applications. 
Additionally, while blockchain is transparent it is also private, concealing the identity 
of any individual with complex and secure codes that can protect the sensitivity of Resource 
data. The decentralized nature of the technology also allows Resource managers, Government to 
share the same information quickly and safely.

### üóíÔ∏è Introduction
This project effectively stores the data of different resources on the blockchain network. Nowadays we see much Corruption related to natural resources for eg: in Bihar in 1999 when Lalu Yadav was the Minister of Railways he declared that 30 % of coal which came to the energy station was wiped out during transportation. But it was not the case it was sold in black markets for Millions by doing some fraud with the central database which manages the coal records and he was never caught for that because it is easy to manipulate the data which stored centrally at a particular location So by keeping a whole record of all the natural resources which comes to  particular locations on the Block Chain Networks it will be impossible for anyone to do changes in the networks.
